"""Helpers to log request data safely.

* :func:`safe` neutralizes log injection (CR / LF and other control
  characters) and bounds the length of any value taken from a request.
* :func:`summarize_credential_request` describes a credential request by
  its shape (configuration id, proof types and counts, encryption) without
  logging proofs, keys or tokens.

Personal data, tokens, proofs, pre-authorized codes and transaction codes must
never be logged; log identifiers and outcomes instead.
